The Bolt: Light Sensor is one of the three sensors that we have gone over in the lessons. This sensor specifically allows us to program the Bolt to react differently based on the amount of light we expose the bolt to. It becomes light sensitive meaning that less light can create one reaction and more light can create another depending on how one programs it. For example in our lesson, we could get the Bolt develops data and based on the light exposure, with the data it is able to produce an image that has been programmed to display according to that exposure level. The Bolt can have different functions to react towards based on the surroundings in this case the light. This function could significantly help when one is trying to observe changes in the environment. Whether the light from the environment is increasing or decreasing. In this way data can be derived and used for further projects. Overall, the Light sensor function allows the Bolt to react to different light based on the dimmness or brightness of the environment which can impact the movement or appearance of the Bolt.

For Me: Nothing went wrong at all at least on my part. The instructions were clear and straight to the point. That's why I didn't face any difficulties following the instructions provided. Therefore, you did a good job in giving the instructions, although at the beginning considering others I would say next time have the whole class follow along so that there isn't anyone left behind or confused.
For You: I didn't have any issues at all with this assignment so I don't really have much to say. Like I said the instructions were super clear and straight to the point without anything else that could potentially cause it be confusing.

Ease of Use: Python is easier because it is more straightforward and more precise. It actually makes you interact more and understand the properties of the language better. Problem-Solving: The two had specific instructions that were clear and easy to understand which helped me look back at the work to figure out what could possibly be wrong. Flexibility: I have more flexibility and control on python because I am able to code stuff specifically to how I want it without a whole process. Real-World Application: It can help me program website or games. It is something that specific careers look for and it could help you figure out issues in the programming of certain things outside in the real world if one is encountered.

Computer science has allowed there to be many resourceful sources in the world. For example right now, I am using a product of computer science. Without computer science, half of what we know if not more would not exist. Such as machinery that has been programmed, websites, apps, and simple things like phone calls on the phone would not exist. We would be back to the old days in which everything had to be set manually. Processes would take longer and the advancements in technology would not even cross our minds. Currently computer science, has inspired many people into creating what we have now. Resources that have become vital overtime as we grow more dependent on it. If for whatever reason it stopped exisiting we would be lost for sure.

Job Title: Computer Programmer
Job Description: The main responsibilities or tasks that computer programmers have to accomplish are basically writing code, making programs, and scripts. They also must test the code and all their work overall as well as update, analyze, and collaborate in their projects. 
Skills Required: A variety of skills are needed such as the basic communication, organizational, multitasking, and attention to detal skills. More hardcore skills needed are the familiarization of programming languages, the understanding of software development, data structures and algorithms, and understanding of databases.
Education and Experience: It really varies but some computer programmers only require an associate degree, certificatem or a diploma. Sometimes if one wants to go study for more opportunities a 4-year span in college can get a person a Bachelor's degree.
Career Growth: The employment for this career outlook is -10%. So it basically it isn't exactly growing rather it is being projected to decline unfortunately in the upcoming years from now to 2031. 
Reflection: This career path is not bad at all, it can really be useful and for sure expand to other branches in computer science. Although the employment rate is decreasing it doesn't mean that computer programmers aren't essential to our community and other roles within the field can open. There are lots of skills that need to be acquired but overtime these skills can drop as one studies to get at least an associates or a bachelor's degree. It is definetly a challenging career but it is rewarding towards the end.

Coding can be very useful in different settings as it can help improve problem-solving skills, can help industries out, and it can enhance creativity and or collaboration. Problem-solving skills can improve as you learn the language. By learning the language whether that be java or python, you are basically able to create and revise work that has had errors. For example sometimes coding errors may occur and that requires problem-solving skills to be used in order to identify and make a change for the program to work smoothly. Industries can also greatly benefit as for example in the medical fields records need to be stored in data bases to ensure that people receive the right treatements and that their identity along with medical history is safe and classified. Of course this requires the use of computers and coding in order to ensure that everything is stored properly. Also, people like Mark Zuckerberg who owns Facebook, requires his app to use coding as bugs, system updates, and the overall foundation of the app relies on it. Furthermore, coding allows the creativity and collaboration between people to grow. Take for example us students, we are using coding and at some point we will use it to create our own things such as a website for fun or to collaborate with our peers to solve a problem or again create something new with the skills we acquire overtime. This is why coding in different situations is super beneficial.

AI has impacted our society in many ways both negatively and positively overtime in multiple areas like healthcare, education, and transportation. Firstly, focusing on the negatives it is important to note that AI exists because we have developed it. Obviously, as we know we make many mistakes and during the process AI can be affected during its programmation. We may include unintentional mistakes that can significantly affect the results that the bot provides in the long run. It could have biases that should have not been implemented. Furthermore, looking at it in a much broader perspective, AI has taken a revolutionary turn in which it takes control of multiple areas with ease. It is adaptive and it takes in whatever information is at its reach. Some information may be flawed and it can cause issues in the long run and negatively impact industries like the healthcare systems specifically. Everything must be precise to ensure that patients get the right treatments, but with errors in the way patients are at risk. This expands to other industries as well and it can cause many issues that can slow down processes like in eduction in which students may use AI to cheat on assignments and therefore not retain any valueable information being taught to them. As for the positives, AI is a very good tool if used properly. If AI is being used to solve really complex problems it can be beneficial. It provides quick and rapid answers and it can actually help fix errors faster than a human being. It can provide services to multiple people who need it and it makes work more efficient. AI is also a great tool to secure things and manage programs and more. It can even be great when paired with humans as we both adapt to work together and solve problems with our own abilities, as AI is not able to solve certain things like we do. Really, both are dependent in each other no matter how we see AI as. It has its ups and downs and that's ok, because as we continue to innovate, AI becomes a tool that can greatly boost our advancments or sometimes may be a slow down in which we must use our solving skills to fix.

Computer science and technology can be beneficial but also harmful when it comes to elections. Sure, computer science can help count numbers faster and effienciently to reduce the long time to count thousands of votes. It also helps campaigns to make themselves know prior to voting on social media. It enhances the overall presentation and allows for running candidates to make themselves known by many in rapid rates. The downside of such use is that many times some votes may be counted more than once or missed which can cause an error with the numbers and therefore cause a false result. As for in social media, the computer science and technology can be used to harm the imagine of a candidate. There is a high chance that the technology can be used by people with malicious intentions. Voices can be replicated and the candidates social media can be hacked into. Therefore, false information may be spread and people will most likely believe it and be influenced to change their vote without a plausable reason. There is so much more that can go well when it comes to using these tools in times of elections, but it is important to note that even if something is really good, it can still have its downfalls. So yes, it can help candidates and the people overall, but it can also damage the candidates image and the voters voice.

Our personal and sensitive information is something we must keep away from anyone that could pose a threat. That is why it is important to always be careful when publishing anything online. We must ensure that our personal information isn't exposed to the many possible threats that could appear with time. Whether it be people hacking, companies taking information from you without your permission and much more. It can go as far as your identity being taken if you are not careful. In order to keep that type of data secure you must always ensure that you first off, don't put anything super personal up. What ever goes online stays online despite you deleting it. You must then only publish anything you want that doesn't involve personal information like location, age, etc. Secure your account with a strong password and only share files with those you trust or know. Furthermore, if you don't want something to be seen by thousands of people. make sure that the setting is switched to private so that only you can see it. No, I was always warned and supervised by my parents to ensure that nothing personal went out to the digital world. This would keep me safe from any danger that floats around on the web. If you work collaborately make sure you know who you are working with. Don't give out any personal information at all to those you are collaborating with unless required or crucial. Even then be weary and ensure that it isn't any information such as credit card info, social security, or passwords. At the end there is always a digital footprint that sticks to you and can affect you personally. So it is important to take care of your data online as it can greatly influence many other factors later on.

Currently the event that has specifically impacted my community the most has been the elections. Many people have gone to polls to vote and some have sent their vote through mail. Some votes have been counted by computer systems that obviously require specific programmization that helps quickly establish votes and help give more accurate projections. This basically is data analysis and overall how technology can be beneficial. Although, there are many skeptics who claim that the systems may have been hacked into and votes were changed or dismissed. This problem can be fixed with the advanced technology that currently exists. 
It is possible that this may have occured and as we know data analysis is very crucial especially in events like these. Specifically our advancements have allowed us to use problem-solving skills to fix issues like these in our technology. Stengthening our systems and learning ways to prevent hackers from interfering with very sensitive topics. Furthermore, using the new advancements can actually provide users that security when casting their votes and their personal information. Apart from helping the democracy overall by avoided fraud. In this world technology along with advancements calls for updates and growing minds to catch up to the demands that rise overtime which is crucial in our dependent world.

Technology in the food industry can be super beneficial but it also has its downs. First and for most, technology has enabled us to process things faster. Workers can now use the technology to collect data, analyze, proceed with payments, and ensure that fraud is minimized. It also saves time and allows for faster productivity in the long run. The new technology has enabled us to be able to order things online as well. This helps us receive not just our food but give us time to do other things as it arrives. It also helps transactions to move forward faster than manually. Our technology also informs us about nutritional facts and caloric intake which can be helpful for many of us to ensure that we stay healthy and safe. Now although it has many more benefits it also has its flaws. Such include malfunction when analyzing data which can distrupt the agricultural process significantly. It can also take away jobs from people and it can also promote "lazyness." What is meant by lazyness is that we will become more dependent on the technology, preventing us from using our communication skills to use. It also takes away from our own productivity especially if we are relient on our advancements to take care of simple tasks revolving around food. It really takes away that social aspect from us and promotes impulsive decision makings especially since everything is a button away from being delivered to us. It really has its own risks but again it determines on how it is being used. As part of the economy yes it is a really great tool but for users it can be very tempting and it can affect our mental and physical well being in the long run if not used carefully.

Artificial Intelligence has come a long way and something that past generations had dreamed of were robots. In August 19, 2021, Elon Musk developed the Tesla Robot which on average costs between $20-$30 thousand dollars. It can do a range of things such as moving things, cleaning, and even being a companion for someone. It is really advanced and it is great because it can accomplish tasks that we may not be able to do easily. Helping disabled people or just simply helping anyone who needs an extra hand around. This is exciting news because it goes to prove just how much our technology has evolved. So much as to creating something that can serve as a tool in our world. There are some concerns though when it comes to this Tesla robot like any other piece of technology. Lots of people worry that their robot could potentially be hacked and it can affect their lives greatly in return as it can be possessed by a person wil malicious intent. Data privacy can be taken and so much could possibly go wrong. It is fairly new so the software has to be constantly updated and revised to prevent anything being leaked from the consumers. All in all, the Tesla Robot is a prime example of how much our technology has advanced, how it can greatly make a change by interacting with us and helping us out with simple day to day tasks. Offering support in simple yet much needed ways. In a field this could help serve as an innovative example or even a special agent that can help communicate in various environments with the built-in knowledge. It is always important to consider the risks there are with it though. Like any other technology our privacy is always at stakes so it is important to consider the possible actions that can be done to prevent any accidents from occuring. Fixing it, updating, and expanding our knowledge not just in innovating a new piece but into innovating something that will help strengthen the armor of our data.

Brain rot is a term that has been brought up recently with new content coming up. It normally is strange content that makes absolutely no sense yet makes people laugh. Such examples include Skibidi toilet which is really just a toilet with a man's head. It is very weird and creepy yet young children are obsessed with it and continuously watch it. It definitely affects the mental health of young minds for sure. They become addicted and they normalize what should not be normalized. Nowadays, there is even children walking around singing the songs from this form of brain rot and they believe it is something funny and cool when it is just something inappropriate and should inflict some sort of negative feeling. This is an example of slop, like it has no creativity, it is really just bland and it has no story or value behind it. It just seems to exist and people like it because it is supposedly funny and cool. More of these things came out overtime and overtime it seems like unfunny and strange things are gaining popularity while actual creative works aren't as highlighted today. Definitely, as the years have gone I've encountered random content that makes no sense yet people keep refering to it and making jokes about it, when in reality it is just nonsense being tossed back and forth. There is definitely a way of keeping things away from brain rot and actually still be equally as entertaining. Fun animations, colors, plots, and music could engage the audience and make it more eye catching. There is many more ways of making things less brain rotted and it could actually help younger minds stay away from things that are absolutely bad and don't help them at all growing up.
