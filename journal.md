The Bolt: Light Sensor is one of the three sensors that we have gone over in the lessons. This sensor specifically allows us to program the Bolt to react differently based on the amount of light we expose the bolt to. It becomes light sensitive meaning that less light can create one reaction and more light can create another depending on how one programs it. For example in our lesson, we could get the Bolt develops data and based on the light exposure, with the data it is able to produce an image that has been programmed to display according to that exposure level. The Bolt can have different functions to react towards based on the surroundings in this case the light. This function could significantly help when one is trying to observe changes in the environment. Whether the light from the environment is increasing or decreasing. In this way data can be derived and used for further projects. Overall, the Light sensor function allows the Bolt to react to different light based on the dimmness or brightness of the environment which can impact the movement or appearance of the Bolt.

For Me: Nothing went wrong at all at least on my part. The instructions were clear and straight to the point. That's why I didn't face any difficulties following the instructions provided. Therefore, you did a good job in giving the instructions, although at the beginning considering others I would say next time have the whole class follow along so that there isn't anyone left behind or confused.
For You: I didn't have any issues at all with this assignment so I don't really have much to say. Like I said the instructions were super clear and straight to the point without anything else that could potentially cause it be confusing.

Ease of Use: Python is easier because it is more straightforward and more precise. It actually makes you interact more and understand the properties of the language better. Problem-Solving: The two had specific instructions that were clear and easy to understand which helped me look back at the work to figure out what could possibly be wrong. Flexibility: I have more flexibility and control on python because I am able to code stuff specifically to how I want it without a whole process. Real-World Application: It can help me program website or games. It is something that specific careers look for and it could help you figure out issues in the programming of certain things outside in the real world if one is encountered.

Computer science has allowed there to be many resourceful sources in the world. For example right now, I am using a product of computer science. Without computer science, half of what we know if not more would not exist. Such as machinery that has been programmed, websites, apps, and simple things like phone calls on the phone would not exist. We would be back to the old days in which everything had to be set manually. Processes would take longer and the advancements in technology would not even cross our minds. Currently computer science, has inspired many people into creating what we have now. Resources that have become vital overtime as we grow more dependent on it. If for whatever reason it stopped exisiting we would be lost for sure.

Job Title: Computer Programmer
Job Description: The main responsibilities or tasks that computer programmers have to accomplish are basically writing code, making programs, and scripts. They also must test the code and all their work overall as well as update, analyze, and collaborate in their projects. 
Skills Required: A variety of skills are needed such as the basic communication, organizational, multitasking, and attention to detal skills. More hardcore skills needed are the familiarization of programming languages, the understanding of software development, data structures and algorithms, and understanding of databases.
Education and Experience: It really varies but some computer programmers only require an associate degree, certificatem or a diploma. Sometimes if one wants to go study for more opportunities a 4-year span in college can get a person a Bachelor's degree.
Career Growth: The employment for this career outlook is -10%. So it basically it isn't exactly growing rather it is being projected to decline unfortunately in the upcoming years from now to 2031. 
Reflection: This career path is not bad at all, it can really be useful and for sure expand to other branches in computer science. Although the employment rate is decreasing it doesn't mean that computer programmers aren't essential to our community and other roles within the field can open. There are lots of skills that need to be acquired but overtime these skills can drop as one studies to get at least an associates or a bachelor's degree. It is definetly a challenging career but it is rewarding towards the end.

Coding can be very useful in different settings as it can help improve problem-solving skills, can help industries out, and it can enhance creativity and or collaboration. Problem-solving skills can improve as you learn the language. By learning the language whether that be java or python, you are basically able to create and revise work that has had errors. For example sometimes coding errors may occur and that requires problem-solving skills to be used in order to identify and make a change for the program to work smoothly. Industries can also greatly benefit as for example in the medical fields records need to be stored in data bases to ensure that people receive the right treatements and that their identity along with medical history is safe and classified. Of course this requires the use of computers and coding in order to ensure that everything is stored properly. Also, people like Mark Zuckerberg who owns Facebook, requires his app to use coding as bugs, system updates, and the overall foundation of the app relies on it. Furthermore, coding allows the creativity and collaboration between people to grow. Take for example us students, we are using coding and at some point we will use it to create our own things such as a website for fun or to collaborate with our peers to solve a problem or again create something new with the skills we acquire overtime. This is why coding in different situations is super beneficial.

AI has impacted our society in many ways both negatively and positively overtime in multiple areas like healthcare, education, and transportation. Firstly, focusing on the negatives it is important to note that AI exists because we have developed it. Obviously, as we know we make many mistakes and during the process AI can be affected during its programmation. We may include unintentional mistakes that can significantly affect the results that the bot provides in the long run. It could have biases that should have not been implemented. Furthermore, looking at it in a much broader perspective, AI has taken a revolutionary turn in which it takes control of multiple areas with ease. It is adaptive and it takes in whatever information is at its reach. Some information may be flawed and it can cause issues in the long run and negatively impact industries like the healthcare systems specifically. Everything must be precise to ensure that patients get the right treatments, but with errors in the way patients are at risk. This expands to other industries as well and it can cause many issues that can slow down processes like in eduction in which students may use AI to cheat on assignments and therefore not retain any valueable information being taught to them. As for the positives, AI is a very good tool if used properly. If AI is being used to solve really complex problems it can be beneficial. It provides quick and rapid answers and it can actually help fix errors faster than a human being. It can provide services to multiple people who need it and it makes work more efficient. AI is also a great tool to secure things and manage programs and more. It can even be great when paired with humans as we both adapt to work together and solve problems with our own abilities, as AI is not able to solve certain things like we do. Really, both are dependent in each other no matter how we see AI as. It has its ups and downs and that's ok, because as we continue to innovate, AI becomes a tool that can greatly boost our advancments or sometimes may be a slow down in which we must use our solving skills to fix.

Computer science and technology can be beneficial but also harmful when it comes to elections. Sure, computer science can help count numbers faster and effienciently to reduce the long time to count thousands of votes. It also helps campaigns to make themselves know prior to voting on social media. It enhances the overall presentation and allows for running candidates to make themselves known by many in rapid rates. The downside of such use is that many times some votes may be counted more than once or missed which can cause an error with the numbers and therefore cause a false result. As for in social media, the computer science and technology can be used to harm the imagine of a candidate. There is a high chance that the technology can be used by people with malicious intentions. Voices can be replicated and the candidates social media can be hacked into. Therefore, false information may be spread and people will most likely believe it and be influenced to change their vote without a plausable reason. There is so much more that can go well when it comes to using these tools in times of elections, but it is important to note that even if something is really good, it can still have its downfalls. So yes, it can help candidates and the people overall, but it can also damage the candidates image and the voters voice.
