Today, I started my GitHub account and repository. I'm excited to start using GitHub for my projects!

The Bolt: Light Sensor is one of the three sensors that we have gone over in the lessons. This sensor specifically allows us to program the Bolt to react differently based on the amount of light we expose the bolt to. It becomes light sensitive meaning that less light can create one reaction and more light can create another depending on how one programs it. For example in our lesson, we could get the Bolt develops data and based on the light exposure, with the data it is able to produce an image that has been programmed to display according to that exposure level. The Bolt can have different functions to react towards based on the surroundings in this case the light. This function could significantly help when one is trying to observe changes in the environment. Whether the light from the environment is increasing or decreasing. In this way data can be derived and used for further projects. Overall, the Light sensor function allows the Bolt to react to different light based on the dimmness or brightness of the environment which can impact the movement or appearance of the Bolt.

For Me: Nothing went wrong at all at least on my part. The instructions were clear and straight to the point. That's why I didn't face any difficulties following the instructions provided. Therefore, you did a good job in giving the instructions, although at the beginning considering others I would say next time have the whole class follow along so that there isn't anyone left behind or confused.
For You: I didn't have any issues at all with this assignment so I don't really have much to say. Like I said the instructions were super clear and straight to the point without anything else that could potentially cause it be confusing.

Ease of Use: Python is easier because it is more straightforward and more precise. It actually makes you interact more and understand the properties of the language better. Problem-Solving: The two had specific instructions that were clear and easy to understand which helped me look back at the work to figure out what could possibly be wrong. Flexibility: I have more flexibility and control on python because I am able to code stuff specifically to how I want it without a whole process. Real-World Application: It can help me program website or games. It is something that specific careers look for and it could help you figure out issues in the programming of certain things outside in the real world if one is encountered.
